                            <strong>The Democrats are raising record amounts of money.</strong> Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Beto O’Rourke both raised around $6 million in the first 24 hours of their campaigns. On the congressional side, the DCCC announced they had their best February ever with nearly $3 million coming from online contributions. This is a lot of money that the Democrats will use to attack Republicans and the ideals we believe in.

                            <strong>The Democrats are doing everything they can to roll back Trump’s agenda.</strong> From refusing to provide funding for border security to pledging support for the socialist “Green New Deal”, if they gain control of the Senate, the Democrats will dismantle everything we have accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                            <strong>The mainstream media is on their side.</strong> The news coverage of President Trump and Republicans has become almost comical in how one-sided it appears. While the Democratic presidential candidates get fawning coverage about which jacket they should buy and what type of van they should ride in, Republicans are under a constant barrage of attacks
